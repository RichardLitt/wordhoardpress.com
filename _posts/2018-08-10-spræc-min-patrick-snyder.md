Sprǣc mīn ys ieldra,  
Þonne ic wāt, þū wāst,  
Þonne sēo woruld wāt.  
Eall sprǣce ðǣre eorðan syndon,  
Sindon fela frignunga ymb hī.  
Wæs ān sprǣc, hwannon eall cumeð?  
Hū wæs hit? Hwā spræc hit?  
Hwæt sægdon hīe? For hwī sægdon hīe hit?  
Hwǣr wunodon hī?  
Æfter fela geara, ān wearþ manig,  
Eall synd gōd, eall synd fæger.

My language is older,  
than I know, you know  
than the world knows.  
All languages of the earth are,  
There are many questions about them.  
Was there a language, whence all come?  
How was it? Who spoke it?  
What did they say? For what did they speak it?  
How did they live?  
After many years, one became many,  
all are good, all are beautiful.
