Richard Littauer is Word Hoard Press's Founding Editor & Editor-in-Chief. He writes often, and has some creative work published in _[Code Poems](code-poems.com)_. He studied Old English at the University of Edinburgh, eventually graduating with an MA (Hons) in Linguistics. He studied for an MSc in Computational Linguistics  at Saarland University and the University of Malta, and will write his thesis one day. He is a web developer who enjoys reading in other languages in his dwindling spare time. He is probably most well known as the creator of the Na'vi dictionary for the Avatar fan community.

## FAQ

#### How will you know if the submissions are good?

Long hours with a dictionary and grammars. Hopefully, some other experts in Old Germanic languages will be keen to help out, and we will do our best to seek out trained language consultants. This is, ultimately, for love of the craft.

#### Why 'Eala'? Why 'Word Hoard'?

_Eala_ is the Old English word for 'Hello.' Its most famous usage was in the poem _Cynewulf_, mostly because of JRR Tolkien's mention of it in his letters.

> *Eala Earendel engla beorhtast*  
> *Ofer middangeard monnum sended*  
>  
> Hail Earendel brightest of angels  
> Over middle-earth sent unto men  

_Word-hoard_ is from the Old English kenning for lexicon, _wordhord_. Beowulf's first words in the epic poem are prefaced _wordhord onl√©ac_, 'he unlocked his word hoard'.

#### I am a native Icelandic or Norse speaker. Can I submit some poems I wrote?

We'd prefer if you submitted only texts which are written in languages that don't exist at the moment, or in the least that you do not know from birth. If you're writing in Old Norse or Old Icelandic (not that they are that different!), feel free to submit those.

#### Will you send me a printed copy?

If we get enough submissions, this is my ultimate goal, yes.

#### Can we have a word list at the end of each submission?

I hope to do this too.

#### So... you're not interested in my rhyming couplets?

Correct. There's no real outlet for verse in the Germanic alliterative tradition that I could find, so that's what this is for. Your end-of-line rhymes and iambic pentameter are welcome elsewhere, I am sure.
