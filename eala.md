Eala publishes on a rolling basis and is currently online-only. Based on the number of accepted submissions, we hope to eventually publish a hard copy edition of our work.

## What We're Looking For

We accept submissions that are written in any Germanic language spoken before or during the Middle Ages. While our primary focus is on Old English, we also will accept anything written in Old English, Middle English, Old Scots, Old Norse, Old and Middle Icelandic, Old Danish, Old Saxon, Old Swedish, Old Gutnish, Gothic, and so on. We do not accept submissions from constructed languages, or submissions with created words.

Any genre of writing is accepted, as long as it conforms to our standards below.

### Original Texts

We encourage and are especially looking for any original texts written in any of the languages above by you, the modern day author. We do no accept previously extant texts.

In general, we will only consider texts that conform to old Germanic poetic standards. This means heavy use of alliterative verse, with inclusion of kennings, caesura, and so on. Please indicate in what style your submission is written; for instance, as classic metrical verse, fornyrðislag, ljóðaháttr, or dróttkvætt. If you are using a rare form, a small essay about the type of form used would be permitted and may be published alongside the original work (we'll work with you on that).

Long form prose is also accepted.

Free verse or rhymed, Romance-influenced poetry will also be accepted based on their own individual merit, but are not especially encouraged.

Poetry text limit: 500 lines.
Prose text limit: 2000 words.

### Translations

We will accept submissions that are translations of any text from before 1500, or translations of modern texts (within the public domain) into Old English . Please also include the original text.

Text limit: 5000 words.
